# Create a Kubernetes cluster

With Portainer Business Edition you can create a Kubernetes cluster on your existing infrastructure directly from the Portainer UI.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Portainer connects to your infrastructure and deploy Kubernetes and the Portainer Agent. You can provide your credentials during the deployment or set them up ahead of time in [Shared credentials](../../../settings/credentials/).
{% endhint %}

At present, we support deploying Talos Kubernetes via Omni and MicroK8s via SSH:

{% content-ref url="omni.md" %}
[omni.md](omni.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

{% content-ref url="microk8s/" %}
[microk8s](microk8s/)
{% endcontent-ref %}
