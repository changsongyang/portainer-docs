# Why is a feature only available in Portainer Business Edition?

Portainer Community Edition requires substantial development efforts to keep it updated, and relevant in a hyper-dynamic market. The cost for this development needs to be funded one way or another, and we have elected to fund this through having a small number of our users paying for a version with premium features. Of course we need these features to be appealing, and that’s why some features that CE users might want are only in BE.
