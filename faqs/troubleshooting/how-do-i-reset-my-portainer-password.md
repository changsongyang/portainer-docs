# How do I reset my Portainer password?

If you know your current password and can log into Portainer, you can set a new password via the Portainer UI.

If you have forgotten your password or are unable to log in, either ask another Portainer admin to reset the password for you, or use our [password reset helper ](../../advanced/reset-admin.md)to reset the default admin account password (from when Portainer was initialized).
