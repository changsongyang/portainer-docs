# How do I log a Support Request?

Only Portainer Business (BE) customers with a Professional or Enterprise subscription can log tickets directly with Portainer. For all other users, we recommend our [community support resources](https://www.portainer.io/get-support-for-portainer?hsLang=en).

\
**How to log a support request:**<br>

* Go to the [Get Support](https://www.portainer.io/get-support-for-portainer?hsLang=en) page on the Portainer website.
* After reviewing the existing resources to see if your question has already been answered, scroll down to the **Get Business Edition Support** section and complete the form.
* Tickets are checked and resolved by Portainer staff within the SLA.
* If we think it's easier to speak to you about a ticket directly, we'll reach out to organize a meeting via Zoom (or similar platform).
