# License already applied error

This error usually appears when you are trying to apply a second five node free license into the same instance of Portainer.&#x20;

Five node free licenses are not stackable in Portainer Business. You can only apply one five node free license key per instance of Portainer.&#x20;

If this is not the case then the problem could be a bug in the product. Please send us an [email](mailto:success@portainer.io) an include all the steps you had taken prior to receiving the error message. &#x20;
