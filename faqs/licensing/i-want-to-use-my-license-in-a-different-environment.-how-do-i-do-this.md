# I want to use my License in a different environment. How do I do this?

You will need to downgrade the Portainer instance in your environment to the Community Edition.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Note:  You can only downgrade a Business Edition to Community if you have upgraded from Community in the first place. &#x20;
{% endhint %}

Install Business Edition or upgrade to Business Edition in the new environment.  You will need to use your existing license.
