# How do I renew my 5 nodes free license?

It's important to note:&#x20;

* At the expiry date of your current license, our 5 Nodes Free license will be available **for non-commercial use only**. If you are currently using the 5 Nodes Free license for commercial purposes, please switch to a 3 Nodes Free license by visiting [this link](https://www.portainer.io/switch-to-a-3-nodes-free-license-key-for-5-nodes-free-users?hsLang=en).
* At expiry, non-commercial 5 Nodes Free license holders (home users, hobbyists, and students) who need more than 3 nodes can apply for a new 5 Nodes Free license under the updated [5 nodes free renewal license agreement](https://www.portainer.io/5nf-license-agreement-renewal?hsLang=en).&#x20;
* Current 5 Nodes Free home or business users who need 3 nodes or less will be able to [switch to our 3 Nodes Free program](https://www.portainer.io/switch-to-a-3-nodes-free-license-key-for-5-nodes-free-users?hsLang=en) when their current 5 Node Free license expires.
* For business users who need more than 3 nodes at the expiry date of their current 5 Nodes Free license, we offer a range of [pricing](https://www.portainer.io/pricing?hsLang=en) to suit different needs and we'd be happy to work with you to find something suitable.&#x20;
* Please note that we will delay the send of your new key until 14 days before your current license expiry dat&#x65;**.**

You'll need to provide:&#x20;
