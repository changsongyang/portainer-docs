# A valid authorisation token is missing error

#### 1. Try pasting the key again

This error usually appears because the license key has not been pasted correctly.&#x20;

Please try and paste the key again, and make sure there are no spaces at the beginning, end, or in the middle of the key.

The key should start with a "2-" or a "3-" so please include the whole key starting from here.&#x20;

**Note:** "3-" keys [require version 2.18.4](why-isnt-my-3-license-key-working.md) or newer.
