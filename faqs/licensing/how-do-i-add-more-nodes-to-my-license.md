# How do I add more nodes to my license?

Licensing in Portainer Business Edition is based on the number of nodes you are managing. If you want to manage additional clusters or nodes and your license doesn't cover the additional nodes, you will need to buy an additional license..

To buy an additional license, please get in touch with [our success team](https://www.portainer.io/portainer-business-buy-more-nodes?hsLang=en).
