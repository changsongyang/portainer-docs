# Known compatibility issues with Docker Engine 29.0.0

The latest Docker Engine 29.0.0 introduces breaking changes that prevent current Portainer versions from connecting to Docker Standalone environments. Until support is added, please keep using the Docker versions listed on our [requirements page](../../start/requirements-and-prerequisites.md).

A temporary workaround has been found by our community and is detailed under [GitHub Issue 12925](https://github.com/portainer/portainer/issues/12925#issuecomment-3516549977).
