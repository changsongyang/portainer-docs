# What does Portainer's backup include?

Portainer's backup includes the Portainer database as well as any stack files that were deployed using Portainer. The backup does **not** include your environment's containers or their data. The data stored is intended to bring Portainer's configuration back into a known-good state, not the containers that it manages.
