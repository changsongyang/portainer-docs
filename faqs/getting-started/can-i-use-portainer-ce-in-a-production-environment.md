# Can I use Portainer CE in a production environment?

Yes you can; however, we do not recommend it, especially if you’re using Portainer for business critical apps. With a purchase of Portainer Business Edition, you’ll get access to all the extended features that are available in BE, as well help with onboarding, prioritized support, and a dedicated Customer Support Engineer.
