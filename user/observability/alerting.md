# Alerting

{% hint style="info" %}
This section is only available in Portainer Business Edition and only accessible by administrator users.
{% endhint %}

On the Alerting page you can configure alerts for events related to your environments and for Portainer itself. Alerts will display on the Alerting page and notifications can be sent via Slack or Microsoft Teams integration, via email, or by triggering a webhook.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is experimental and we recommend using this in non-production or test environments only at present as there may be unstable and evolving behavior.
{% endhint %}

To access Alerting once the feature is enabled under [experimental features,](../../admin/settings/general.md#experimental-features) click on **Alerting** under **Observability** in the left menu.
