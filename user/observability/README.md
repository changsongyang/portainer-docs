Within the Observability section you can configure alerting for events related to your environments and for Portainer itself.

{% hint style="warning" %}
This feature is experimental and we recommend using this in non-production or test environments only at present as there may be unstable and evolving behavior.

If the Observability feature has not been enabled, clicking on items in this section will take you to the [Settings](../../admin/settings/general.md#experimental-features) page where you can enable the feature.&#x20;
